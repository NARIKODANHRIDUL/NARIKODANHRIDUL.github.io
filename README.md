- **Skills Display:** An overview of the skills I've acquired along my learning journey.
- **Contact Information:** A way for visitors to get in touch with me.
- **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be accessible and visually appealing across various devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- CSS3: Used to style and make the website visually engaging.

## Project Highlights

- **Learning Opportunity:** This project served as a hands-on learning experience, allowing me to solidify my understanding of HTML and CSS.
- **Creativity Unleashed:** Designing the layout and choosing color schemes provided a creative outlet for me.
