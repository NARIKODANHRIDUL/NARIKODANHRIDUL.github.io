                    Became quite interested in chess during my school days and have participated in district-level competitions for two years.
                    <br><br>
                    During my 7th standard, I simply participated in the chess tournament which was conducted with in the school. With the four move check mate which my friend taught me, minutes before the tournament, I won 3 matches easily. Only one opponent broke the four step checkmate. So i had to use my basic chess knowledge to play further. Since he was not a big player i was able to win the game after a little struggle. I was not actually a good player, but this four step checkmate helped me get into the school chess team. 
                    <br><br>
                    But when I get to play with the other students who got selected in the team, I understood where i stand. I was put as reserve out of the 5 members who selected. I went with the team for the district level competetion, but was not able to play a single game. I remained as the reserve player, who can see the district level game from a distance and can also get the sponsered food as other players. Also got to see some cool players who can really blow our mind.

    We had the same team. I was still labelled as a reserve player. But I was learning alot from the practise that was given their and also by witnessing others moves. About 1 week before the District level competition, while the junior team was playing with the senior team, I was playing againist one of the best players in the senior team. For my wonder, I won. Everyone was surprised and was making fun of him. He called a rematch, and again I won. Everyone was shocked and our physical education teacher was surprised. I played again with another senior and played a good game for a draw. Like that i got promoted as the main player. 
    <br><br>
    On the District level competition i got to play as a main player and played a total of 5 games. 2 games won, 2 games lost and 1 game got to be a draw. Which was not great, but is also not that bad as my other team mates also have similar scores. My school didn't won any position there. Still it was a nice experience.
