                When I was in the 11th grade, a new physical education instructor joined our school. As always, I had a strong interest in our annual sports day.This new teacher uncovered an old javelin that had been untouched for years and decided to introduce it as a new event for sports day. I registered my name for the javelin throw competition, as i was excited for participating in a new event. We had to compete against the 12th-grade students as well, adding an extra layer of competition to the mix. The event got over and I got the first position. After that I started getting practise for participating in the district level competition

                Following a workout session post the State level competition, my shoulder got damaged, affecting my ability to practice with proper form. Hence, I had to adjust my throwing technique to avoid pain. National level competition gave a different level of intensity. Every single athletes were looking really motivated and gigantic. At our hotel, I realized that our neighbors were athletes from North India, and they were almost a foot taller than me. When they came to know that I was also participating in the U19 javelin event, they burst into laughter seeing my height. This situation instantly brought to mind motivational films where hero got critisized and at the end he will win, but nothing happended, I failed to pass even the first round where they took only 8 members. I was only able to throw 35m, 37m, and then a foul. Later, on my way back to home, I got the news that the same guy who laughed at me got the first prize for 65m :)

                I haven't got any chance to practice a javelin since the Nationals due to the pandemic and various exams. Only during our college's inaugural athletic meet in our third year did I finally get the opportunity to participate in the javelin event and cherish my old memories. Even though it was tough after a long break, I still came in first place in the college athletic meet.
